# Average-Rainfall-Prediction
Rainfall Prediction is the application of science and technology to predict the amount of rainfall over a region. Different factors such as the month, year, period, temperature, humidity , etc. affects the rainfall in a region

The dataset that is being used is the Average Rainfall in UK(2010-2019) from kaggle.
This data consists of year, month and the period of Uk for the 10 years. Prediction has been made looking at these factors.

The algorithm used for the prediction is 'Random Forest'. The Random forest uses multiple decision trees and chooses the optimum result by selecting the majority.
Since we are working on multiple decision trees there is a chance of less over-fitting. Its accuracy is high and we can estimate missing values
